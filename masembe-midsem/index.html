                <h2>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
                    CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
                    CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
                    External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</h2>
                <p>There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

                    External CSS
                    Internal CSS
                    Inline CSS
                1.An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.
                2.An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
                3.An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.
    
                CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
    
    We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
    
    Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
    Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
    Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
    Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
    Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)</p>
